License
If your project is open source, it's important to include a license. You can use this website to help you pick one.

Changelog
Make a README is inspired by Keep a Changelog. A changelog is another file that is very useful for programming projects.

More Documentation
A README is a crucial but basic way of documenting your project. While every project should at least have a README, more involved ones can also benefit from a wiki or a dedicated documentation website. GitHub, Bitbucket, and GitLab all support maintaining a wiki alongside your project, and here are some tools and services that can help you generate a documentation website:

Daux.io
Docusaurus
GitBook
MkDocs
Read the Docs
ReadMe
Slate
Contributing
Just having a "Contributing" section in your README is a good start. Another approach is to split off your guidelines into their own file (CONTRIBUTING.md). If you use GitHub and have this file, then anyone who creates an issue or opens a pull request will get a link to it.

You can also create an issue template and a pull request template. These files give your users and collaborators templates to fill in with the information that you'll need to properly respond. This helps to avoid situations like getting very vague issues. Both GitHub and GitLab will use the templates automatically.
